# CoderByte Challenges in Node (ES6 Syntax)


After cloning/downloading this repo, run `yarn install` in the project's root.

This repo of code is not intended to be executed in the traditional sense, but rather tested. Upon completing each challenge, a test is added to the suite. *The repo does not need to be built in order to be tested.*

### Testing

`yarn test`

Tests the code with the provided input for each challenge.

`yarn test-watch`

Does the same as above, but in "watch mode".


### Build

`yarn build`

This will transpile the code in /src to Node-compatible CommonJS. The target
director is /dist
